## 02-scope-and-mvp

### ✅ MVP Goal

> *Provide clear, per-site visibility into page usage trends over time for personal websites.*

The MVP deliberately optimizes for insight density over feature breadth.

---

### Included in MVP

The MVP supports:

* Tracking multiple independent websites
* Capturing page view events
* Estimating unique daily visitors
* Aggregating metrics on a daily cadence
* Displaying 30-day historical trends
* Identifying top pages per site
* A minimal, readable dashboard UI

Each of these features exists because it directly supports the MVP goal.

---

### Explicitly NOT in MVP

The following are intentionally excluded to preserve focus:

* User accounts or sharing
* Realtime analytics
* Funnel or session modeling
* Geographic visualization
* Device or browser breakdowns
* Alerting or notifications
* Heatmaps or replay-style tooling

These exclusions are not technical limitations — they are product decisions.
